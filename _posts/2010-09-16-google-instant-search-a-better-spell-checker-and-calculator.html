<p>One of my main uses for Google search is not the searching, but has slowing move towards often queries just for the sake of spell checking. Recently Google released its <a href="http://www.google.com/instant/">instant search</a>. With that, I can easily see my spelling mistakes as I type, no more need to press enter :).</p>
<p>What I found by accident and found it even more useful is using instant search as a calculator. Some of you might know the Google easter egg about the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything">answer to life universe and everything</a>. Google calculator has been part of <a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html">Google's search features</a> for some time now. With the instant search, the results of the calculator is also changed live. A cool and useful example (that was the way that made me discover this) is the binomial coefficient function. Give it a try and play around with it <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=100+choose+50">here</a>.</p>
<p>Happy lazy calculating :)</p>
