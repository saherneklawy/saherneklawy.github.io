<p><strong>Absolutely </strong>Don't Repeat Yourself and Keep It Simple, Stupid! (A DRY KISS) .</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> are common concepts between software developers, but are very difficult to follow. Specially when you start with some idea, run with it, and it starts to layer up in complexity. Without even recognizing it goes out of control. With each of there added layers, you might find yourself repeating things without even recognizing the fact.</p>
<p>Drawing the very fine line between simplicity and and complexity is a very difficult task. It gets even more difficult without taking a step back to look at the big picture, the original aim, the purpose.</p>
<p>This is why an external review of the matter by a 3rd party is often vital. It givesÂ perspective that helps the general good. Such a review process is often excruciating, painful, and long. But in the end of day, without it there is no real gain.</p>
<p>A a final note, I believe that A DRY KISS is something to try and follow in general.</p>
