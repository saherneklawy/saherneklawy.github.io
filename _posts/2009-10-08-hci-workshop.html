<p>My first experience being involved in a workshop was both exciting and educational. This aimed to introduce different technologies technologies to students of the course. They would then choose a technology to work with a project of their proposal.</p>
<p>The workshop started with my Flex presentation. I followed through the standard sequence of over viewing highlights of the framework and showing sample applications.</p>
<p>Following my presentation was the talk by Mohamed Azab regarding Silverlight and WPF. There was a strong competition between these technologies and Flex during his talk. Such competition is always healthy and gives a chance for people to explore different options to perform the similar development tasks.</p>
<p>The day continued with presentations regarding mobile development platforms, where interesting talks were presented by Bahia El Sharkawy (JAVA-ME) and Mariam Rady (Android Framework).</p>
<p>The workshop concluded with my talk on Multitouch surfaces. It contained an the architecture behind building a multitouch enabled software, and the idea for detecting multiple interaction points. Furthermore, a live demo of the Mini Touch &amp; Write table was demonstrated.</p>
<p>In general, the feedback is veryÂ positive, and I hope the talks inspired the students for thinking of highly interactive application ideas.</p>
